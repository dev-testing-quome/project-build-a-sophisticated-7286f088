# project-build-a-sophisticated Architecture

## System Overview
Build a sophisticated contract review and management platform that allows legal teams to collaboratively analyze contracts with version control and approval workflows. The system should enable attorneys to upload and review contracts with markup tools, track document versions and revision history, support collaborative editing with comment and suggestion features, maintain clause libraries and standard templates, provide risk assessment and compliance checking tools, manage approval workflows with electronic signatures, store contracts in secure, searchable databases, generate analytics and reporting on contract terms and performance, support role-based permissions for reviewers, approvers, and administrators, and ensure data security with encryption and audit trails for all contract handling activities.
